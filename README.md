Coloriaget et parcours de graphe en c++

This project is the  graphe color probleme . It's an classical optimization in the graph theeorie. 
Given an undirected graph, the Vertex Coloring Problem (VCP) consists of assigning a color to each vertex of the graph such that two adjacent vertices do not share the same color and the total number of colors is minimized. DSATUR is an effective exact algorithm for the VCP
